"First step: Create a variable and place it with the integer value of 8."
x = 8 #Let x be the first variable

"Thrid step: Create a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers."
z = x + y #z is the result of using the "+" operator with x and y that contains 8 and 10
"Print the value of the sum to the console."
print ("The sum of",x,"+",y,"is",z) #This displays the value of z which is x+y, the result should be 18
