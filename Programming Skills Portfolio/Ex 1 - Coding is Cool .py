print("Exercise 1: Coding is Cool\n")
#The first exercise utilizes variable and the print() funtion

#The original variable to be created is stated by the task is to use 'word 1', 'word 2' and
#'word 3.' 

word1 = ("Coding")
word2 = ("is")
word3 = ("Cool")

print (word1, word2, word3)#This is the first result

#The variable can be changed. The variable I've chosen follows the rules in making the 
#variables, which is case sensitive, not using a number on the first character, and only 
#using alpha-numeric characters.

Noun = ("Coding ") #Noun is my variable that contains the string "Coding "
LVerb = ("is ") #The Noun and LVerb variable has a space after the word because the function uses +
Adj = ("Cool") #Adj stands for adjective that contains the "Cool" string.

#The print function displays the value of the variable or the arguments in the parenthesis.
print (f'\t{Noun} {LVerb} {Adj}')#This is the second result, using \t adds an indent to the result

#Same result will happen if a collection of letters and numbers are surrounded by quotations 
#are inside the parenthesis
print ("\t\tCoding is Cool")#This is the third result
