              Welcome to the world of Runeterra, a world of magic and technology, war and tranquility, heroes and villains.
              This is how the events of this world shape and mould the current day of Runeterra. 
              The Arcane shows the past that results the present, and other realities that it brought.

              A Netflix series made by the game company Riot Games and the French animation company Fortiche, was a hit among fans and watchers because of the compelling
              and intricate story that allows people to get hooked right away. It also shows how the animated series explains contexts and plots that
              do not need them to play the game the story is based on. They are planning to make a third season exploring other continents
              of the world of Runeterra, where the story takes place. 
            </p>
            <p class="b">
              The first and second seasons occur in the twin cities called Piltover and Zaun. Piltover is a place of technological progress,
              where people from different cities gather and trade for goods. The place is full of life as the sky is seen from its tall buildings.
              It is a stark comparison against its other twin, Zaun. Zaun is an underground city, where morals are gray and hardships are born with.
              The city is full of pollutants that makes the quality of life contrasts those who are above them.

              It starts with the two sisters, orphaned to a barkeep named Vander. Being a Zaunite, the sisters and their friends went for a heist,
              looting a residence that was tipped by the 'little guy'. Then one action made their life change forever as a magical artifact that 
              the younger sister tried to steal struck the ground. 
            </p>
            <p class="d">
              The topsiders they call Pilties knew about the incident and decided to take action, making their military force hunt in the underbelly of Zaun.
              To protect the sisters, Vander, decided to sacrifice himself which is found out by Violet, the older sister. The then tried to take his place.
              The plan failed as the chem-baron, Silco, decided to ambush both the barkeep and the police force. He sucessfully captured Vander and eliminated the piltover force.
              The sisters determined to get their foster father back, they tried to sneak in and free him. But due to differences, they failed and things got much worse.
            </p>
            <p class="d">
              Years pass by, the sisters grew up in different situations, separated by their actions. Powder developed a persona of mayhem and destruction,
              named Jinx. Its the same word Vi (Violet) called her before they split up, and with this persona, she wrecked havoc as the left hand man of Silco.
              Violet, taken in to prison by the remaining Piltovan officer, was released by Caitlyn Kiramman. Caitlyn is an officer who tracks down Jinx,
              who made mayhem and chaos on the topside and tries to bring her to justice. But her only lead is Vi. 
            </p>
            <p class="d">
              Along this, Caitlyn's friend - Jayce Talos, is developing a new technology where people with no magical ability could harness magic.
              He is inspired by his past for he is saved by a wizard that handed him a magical rune. With his friend and partner, Viktor who has a 
              disease that made him cripple, tries to do it in secret, but they are caught by Mel Medarda. Mel, even though a council member, saw
              a bright future with them and decided to keep it a secret, hence them succeeding and creating Hextech. Heimerdinger, a small Yordle
              professor and council member, was astonished as he saw what was happening and gave partial approval to their works.

              The story goes intense as the rivalry of topsiders and undercity goes in a full blown out war, trying to take control of each other,
              while the two sisters tries to reunite held back by their differences. Actions create consequences that none could've guessed.
              This is just a summary of the season 1 as things go haywire and wrapped up in season 2. The story of Piltover and Zaun ends there as
              a new region's story is the next season's target.
