              Welcome to the world of Runeterra, a world of magic and technology, war and tranquility, heroes and villains.
              This is how the events of this world shape and mould the current day of Runeterra. 
              The Arcane shows the past that results the present, and other realities that it brought.

              A Netflix series made by the game company Riot Games and the French animation company Fortiche, was a hit among fans and watchers because of the compelling
              and intricate story that allows people to get hooked right away. It also shows how the animated series explains contexts and plots that
              do not need them to play the game the story is based on. They are planning to make a third season exploring other continents
              of the world of Runeterra, where the story takes place.

              The first and second seasons occur in the twin cities called Piltover and Zaun. Piltover is a place of technological progress,
              where people from different cities gather and trade for goods. The place is full of life as the sky is seen from its tall buildings.
              It is a stark comparison against its other twin, Zaun. Zaun is an underground city, where morals are gray and hardships are born with.
              The city is full of pollutants that makes the quality of life contrasts those who are above them.
